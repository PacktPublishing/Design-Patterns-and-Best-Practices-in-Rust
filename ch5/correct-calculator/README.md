# Correct Calculator - Chapter 5

This directory contains the beginnings of the "Correct Calculator" project, demonstrating Rust design patterns related to object creation.

## Features Implemented in Chapter 5
- Basic calculator structure with tokens and expressions
- Factory Methods for token creation
- Abstract Factory pattern for different calculator modes
- Builder pattern for expression construction
- Alternatives to Singleton and Prototype patterns

## Running the Code
To build and run the calculator:

```bash
cargo run
```

This initial implementation focuses on the structure and creation patterns. In subsequent chapters, we'll add more functionality for expression evaluation, state management, and advanced features.
